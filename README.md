Scripts for the Perfect Tower 2 Adventure Mini Game

How to use:
Change first line to 0.1 if you have boots, 0.2 if not
Need all scripts
Clear all rooms directly adjacent to the starting room
Start in entry way (planned starting position is in room two to the left of center)
Click r to start

Ways to make better:
Implement dfs (checking for walls) to find path to target coordinate and only move along path (use string to store path), to avoid traversing the whole room
Deal with rock walls (currently cannot)
Make it so it can deal with enemies that have more health than we have attack
Condense scripts to take up less lines or script slots

Requirements:
17 script spots
Atleast 24 lines for scripts
