Scripts for the Perfect Tower 2 Adventure Mini Game<br />

How to use:<br />
Change first line to 0.1 if you have boots, 0.2 if not<br />
Need all scripts<br />
Clear all rooms directly adjacent to the starting room<br />
Start in entry way (planned starting position is in room two to the left of center)<br />
Click r to start<br />

Ways to make better:<br />
Implement dfs (checking for walls) to find path to target coordinate and only move along path (use string to store path), to avoid traversing the whole room<br />
Deal with rock walls (currently cannot)<br />
Make it so it can deal with enemies that have more health than we have attack<br />
Condense scripts to take up less lines or script slots<br />

Requirements:<br />
17 script spots<br />
Atleast 24 lines for scripts<br />
